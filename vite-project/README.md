# Sport Center

Previously, we created a sample website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This time, we updated the project using React.
This project allows users to access information about the classes, trainers, equipment, customer reviews, and live location of a sports center.

## Features

-You can get information about the classes.
-You can browse through the trainers.
-You can calculate your BMI by entering your weight and height.
